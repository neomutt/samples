# Name: status_format 
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Controls the format of the status line displayed in the “index” menu.
# This string is similar to $index_format, but has its own set of
# printf(3)-like sequences:
# 
# %b     Number of mailboxes with new mail *
# %d     Number of deleted messages *
# %f     The full pathname of the current mailbox
# %F     Number of flagged messages *
# %h     Local hostname
# %l     Size (in bytes) of the current mailbox *
# %L     Size (in bytes) of the messages shown (i.e., which match the current limit) *
# %m     The number of messages in the mailbox *
# %M     The number of messages shown (i.e., which match the current limit) *
# %n     Number of new messages in the mailbox *
# %o     Number of old unread messages *
# %p     Number of postponed messages *
# %P     Percentage of the way through the index
# %r     Modified/read-only/won't-write/attach-message indicator, According to $status_chars
# %R     Number of read messages *
# %s     Current sorting mode ($sort)
# %S     Current aux sorting method ($sort_aux)
# %t     Number of tagged messages *
# %u     Number of unread messages *
# %v     NeoMutt version string
# %V     Currently active limit pattern, if any *
# %>X    Right justify the rest of the string and pad with “X”
# %|X    Pad to the end of the line with “X”
# %*X    Soft-fill with character “X” as pad
# 
# For an explanation of “soft-fill”, see the $index_format documentation.
# 
# * = can be optionally printed if nonzero
# 
# Some  of  the above sequences can be used to optionally print a string if
# their value is nonzero.  For example, you may only want to see the number
# of flagged messages if such messages exist, # since zero is not
# particularly meaningful.  To optionally print a string based upon one of
# the above sequences, the following construct is used:
#
# %?<sequence_char>?<optional_string>?
#
#
# where sequence_char is a character from the table above, and
# optional_string is the string you would like printed if sequence_char is
#nonzero.  optional_string may contain other sequences  as well as normal
# text, but you may not nest optional strings.
#
# 
# Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of new messages in a mailbox:
# 
# %?n?%n new messages.?
# 
# You can also switch between two strings using the following construct:
# 
# %?<sequence_char>?<if_string>&<else_string>?
# 
# If the value of sequence_char is non-zero, if_string will be expanded, otherwise else_string will be expanded.
# 
# You can force the result of any printf(3)-like sequence to be lowercase
# by prefixing the sequence character with an underscore (“_”) sign.  For
# example, if you want to display the local host‐ # name in lowercase, you
# would use: “%_h”. If you prefix the sequence character with a colon
# (“:”) character, NeoMutt will replace any dots in the expansion by
# underscores. This might # be helpful with IMAP folders that don't like
# dots in folder names.
