# Name: index_format 
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This variable allows you to customize the message index display to your
# personal taste.
#
# “Format strings” are similar to the strings used in the C function
# printf(3) to format output (see the man page for more details).  For an
# explanation of the %? construct, see the status_format description.  The
# following sequences are defined in NeoMutt:
#
# %a     Address of the author
# %A     Reply-to address (if present; otherwise: address of author)
# %b     Filename of the original message folder (think mailbox)
# %B     The list to which the letter was sent, or else the folder name (%b).
# %C     Current message number
# %c     Number of characters (bytes) in the message
# %D     Date and time of message using date_format and local timezone
# %d     Date and time of message using date_format and sender's timezone
# %e     Current message number in thread
# %E     Number of messages in current thread
# %F     Author name, or recipient name if the message is from you
# %f     Sender (address + real name), either From: or Return-Path:
# %g     Newsgroup name (if compiled with NNTP support)
# %g     Message tags (e.g. notmuch tags/imap flags)
# %Gx    Individual message tag (e.g. notmuch tags/imap flags)
# %H     Spam attribute(s) of this message
# %I     Initials of author
# %i     Message-id of the current message
# %J     Message tags (if present, tree unfolded, and != parent's tags)
# %K     The list to which the letter was sent (if any; otherwise: empty)
# %L     If an address in the “To:” or “Cc:” header field matches an address Defined by the users “subscribe” command, this displays "To <list-name>", otherwise the same as %F
# %l     Number of lines in the message (does not work with maildir, Mh, and possibly IMAP folders)
# %M     Number of hidden messages if the thread is collapsed
# %m     Total number of message in the mailbox
# %N     Message score
# %n     Author's real name (or address if missing)
# %O     Original save folder where NeoMutt would formerly have Stashed the message: list name or recipient name If not sent to a list
# %P     Progress indicator for the built-in pager (how much of the file has been displayed)
# %q     Newsgroup name (if compiled with NNTP support)
# %R     Comma separated list of “Cc:” recipients
# %r     Comma separated list of “To:” recipients
# %S     Single character status of the message (“N”/“O”/“D”/“d”/“!”/“r”/“*”)
# %s     Subject of the message
# %T     The appropriate character from the $to_chars string
# %t     “To:” field (recipients)
# %u     User (login) name of the author
# %v     First name of the author, or the recipient if the message is from you
# %W     Name of organization of author (“Organization:” field)
# %x     “X-Comment-To:” field (if present and compiled with NNTP support)
# %X     Number of MIME attachments (please see the “attachments” section for possible speed effects)
# %Y     “X-Label:” field, if present, and (1) not at part of a thread tree, (2) at the top of a thread, or (3) “X-Label:” is different from Preceding message's “X-Label:”
# %y     “X-Label:” field, if present
# %Z     A  three  character  set  of  message  status  flags.   The  first  character  is  new/read/replied  flags  (“n”/“o”/“r”/“O”/“N”).   The  second  is   deleted   or   encryption   flags
# (“D”/“d”/“S”/“P”/“s”/“K”).  The third is either tagged/flagged (“*”/“!”), or one of the characters Listed in $to_chars.
# %zc    Message crypto flags
# %zs    Message status flags
# %zt    Message tag flags
# %{fmt} the date and time of the message is converted to sender's time zone, and “fmt” is expanded by the library function strftime(3); a leading bang disables locales
# %[fmt] the date and time of the message is converted to the local time zone, and “fmt” is expanded by the library function strftime(3); a leading bang disables locales
# %(fmt) the local date and time when the message was received.  “fmt” is expanded by the library function strftime(3); a leading bang disables locales
# %>X    right justify the rest of the string and pad with character “X”
# %|X    pad to the end of the line with character “X”
# %*X    soft-fill with character “X” as pad
#
# Date format expressions can be constructed based on relative dates. Using the date formatting operators along with nested conditionals, the date format can be modified based on how old a mes‐
# sage is.  See the section on “Conditional Dates” for an explanation and examples “Soft-fill” deserves some explanation: Normal right-justification will print everything to  the  left  of  the
# “%>”,  displaying  padding and whatever lies to the right only if there's room. By contrast, soft-fill gives priority to the right-hand side, guaranteeing space to display it and showing pad‐
# ding only if there's still room. If necessary, soft-fill will eat text leftwards to make room for rightward text.
#
# Note that these expandos are supported in “save-hook”, “fcc-hook” and “fcc-save-hook”, too.
