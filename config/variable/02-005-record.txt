# Name: record
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This specifies the file into which your outgoing messages should be
# appended.  (This is meant as the primary method for saving a copy of your
# messages, but another way  to  do this  is using the “my_hdr” command to
# create a “Bcc:” field with your email address in it.) The value of
# $record is overridden by the $force_name and $save_name variables, and
# the “fcc-hook” command.  Also see $copy.
